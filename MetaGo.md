# Backup for MetaGo extension

I think it is a **realy** cool one, but after using it for a while it just populates too much stuff automatically and I keep accidentally hitting some shortcuts. 


[MetaGo](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=metaseed.metago) - this one is for really mouseless navigation. 

## Metago shortcuts: 
* ```Alt /``` for jumping to any character in the current file. 
* add ```Shift``` if you want to select additionaly 
* ```Alt P``` to select surounding brackets 
* add ```Shift``` for content and
* add ```Ctrl``` for both 
* ```Alt '``` toggle bookmark. 
* ```Alt \``` show all bookmarks
* ```Alt [``` and ```Alt ]``` navigate bookmarks
